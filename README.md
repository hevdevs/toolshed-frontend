Toolshed is a decentralised community item library. It's aim is to promote sharing of resources and build community spirit whilst saving the user money and reducing unnecessary waste, by facilitating lending and borrowing in a board of posts/requests and user-to-user chatrooms.

Toolshed was developed in an 8 day sprint as part of Northcoders final project phase by @adamrleigh @eobr @Eth4nF @hevmag @k-huggs.
